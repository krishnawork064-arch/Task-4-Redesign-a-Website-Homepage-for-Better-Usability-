 Before & After Overview
The original IEHE Bhopal homepage appeared outdated and cluttered, with inconsistent colors, dense navigation, and weak visual hierarchy—making it hard for users to find key information.
In the redesigned version, I introduced a modern, minimal layout with simplified navigation, balanced spacing, and a strong hero section featuring clear call-to-action buttons. Consistent typography, cohesive colors, and improved readability now create a professional, user-friendly experience that better reflects the institute’s identity.
